Level AI Design System Repository

Overview

The Level AI Design System is a comprehensive UI component library and style guide, built as a shared resource for all Level AI applications. It encapsulates the Level AI brand guidelines (colors, typography, logos) into reusable components using modern tools: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and React. The goal is to ensure a consistent look and feel across web and mobile apps, with a focus on theming (light/dark modes), accessibility (WCAG-compliant contrast and ARIA support), and ease of use for developers. All components are designed to be accessible, leveraging Radix UI primitives under the hood for correct semantics and keyboard navigation, while allowing full customization via Tailwind CSS . The system also integrates Storybook for interactive documentation and includes testing utilities to maintain quality. Both React (web) and React Native (mobile) environments are supported, so teams can use the same design tokens and similar components on all platforms.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized in a developer-friendly way, using a monorepo structure to separate web and native implementations while sharing common assets and configuration:
•	packages/ – Monorepo folder containing platform-specific packages and shared resources.
o	design-system-web/ – The React (web) component library package. This includes all UI components built with shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS, as well as web-specific styles.
o	design-system-native/ – The React Native component library package. It provides RN equivalents of the web components (using NativeWind for Tailwind-like styling on mobile and headless ARIA logic for accessibility). The API is kept as close as possible to the web components for consistency.
o	design-tokens/ – (Optional) A shared package exporting design tokens (colors, font scales, spacing, etc.) in a framework-agnostic format (e.g. JSON or TypeScript constants). This allows both web and native packages to consume the same source of truth for theming.
•	apps/storybook/ – A Storybook configuration for the design system. This includes Storybook setup files and stories for each component demonstrating usage, variants, and responsive behavior. Storybook serves as both a documentation site and a visual testing environment. (It can be deployed to a site like ui.wearelevel.ai for easy access by team members.)
•	assets/ – Brand asset files such as logos and icons in SVG format. All official Level AI logo variants are stored here (primary horizontal logo, secondary vertical logo, monochrome versions, and the standalone logomark icon), to be easily imported into apps.
•	docs/ – Additional documentation, guides, and possibly markdown files describing design principles, how to contribute, coding standards, etc. This may include a README.md at the root of the repo that gives an overview and quick start guide.
•	.github/ – Configuration for repository management (issue templates, workflows for CI/CD, etc.), ensuring quality checks (like linting, tests, Storybook build) run on pull requests.

Each package has its own package.json for independent versioning. The project uses a tool like TurboRepo or Lerna to manage the monorepo, so developers can work on components and see updates in Storybook or a test app immediately.

Technologies and Implementation Details

Shadcn/UI + Tailwind (React Web): For the web package, we utilize shadcn/ui components as a foundation. Shadcn provides a set of pre-built, accessible components based on Radix UI primitives, already wired up with Tailwind CSS classes . This means we get a comprehensive range of UI elements (forms, buttons, modals, menus, etc.) that follow best practices for accessibility (focus management, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) and are easy to theme. We adopt shadcn’s components (e.g. Buttons, Dialogs, Dropdowns, Tables, etc.) and then customize their styles to match Level AI’s brand. Tailwind CSS is configured with Level AI theme extensions (colors, fonts, etc.), so the default styling of these components (which use utility classes) will reflect our brand palette and typography. For example, the primary Button component might use the brand’s Sunshine Yellow for its background by default, and our chosen font (DM Sans) for its label. The result is a set of beautifully designed controls consistent with Level AI’s look, without sacrificing accessibility or flexibility . Developers can also still use Tailwind utilities alongside for layout or minor tweaks, as needed.

Tailwind Configuration: We extend the Tailwind config to include our design tokens. This involves defining a custom color palette (see Color Palette below) in tailwind.config.js (under theme.colors). Each brand color is given a name (e.g., earthstone, sunshine, etc.) so it can be used as bg-earthstone, text-sunshine classes in our components’ JSX. We also set up font families in Tailwind (theme.fontFamily), including Level AI’s fonts DM Sans and Concert One (with appropriate fallbacks). Additionally, we define spacing scale, border radius, and other tokens if needed to match the brand’s style (for instance, if the brand uses particular corner radii or shadows consistently, we encode those in the theme). Tailwind’s configuration is also tuned for dark mode support by using the class strategy (e.g. adding dark: variants) or CSS variables (more on theming below). We ensure that utility classes for states (hover, focus, disabled) are included and that Tailwind plugins (such as forms or typography plugins) are used as necessary for better base styling of elements. All CSS is organized in the styles/ directory (for example, a globals.css that includes Tailwind’s base, and perhaps some resets or global styles like setting font-family for body).

Theming and Dark Mode: The design system supports multiple themes, including Light and Dark mode out of the box. We implement theming using Tailwind’s recommended approach of CSS variables for colors, which makes theme switching easier . For example, we define semantic color variables like --background, --foreground, --primary and use them in Tailwind classes (via the .bg-primary and .text-primary-foreground utilities) . The default :root variables correspond to the Light theme’s values (e.g., --background: #FFFFFF, --foreground: #293f3b which is Earthstone for text on light) and a [data-theme="dark"] (or .dark) selector overrides them with Dark theme values (e.g., --background: #121212 or a dark neutral, and --foreground: #ffffdc or Pale Dawn for text) – ensuring sufficient contrast. We enable Tailwind’s darkMode option (likely set to 'class') so that adding a .dark class on an element (usually on the <html> tag or a parent container) will trigger all dark variants. Each component is designed to look good in both themes: for instance, the Card component might have bg-card which resolves to white in light mode and a dark gray in dark mode, and text-card-foreground for text which flips accordingly . We adhere to the brand guideline’s requirement that color combinations meet at least WCAG AA contrast standards . This means our theme color choices for text vs. background (and component states like button text on button background) are checked for contrast ratio. For example, on the Sunshine Yellow background, we use a very dark text (likely Earthstone or black) to ensure readability . The theming system is flexible – new themes can be added by extending the CSS variables (for example, a high-contrast theme for accessibility or a custom client theme if needed) simply by adding a new [data-theme="X"] with a different set of color variables. The use of CSS variables and Tailwind’s design tokens makes switching themes dynamic and straightforward.

Storybook Integration: We use Storybook to document and test the design system components in isolation. Storybook is set up in the repository (with a custom webpack/vite configuration to handle Tailwind and any required polyfills). For each component (e.g., Button), we create a corresponding .stories.tsx file showcasing its variants (primary, secondary, disabled, etc.), states (hover, focus, active), and theming (light/dark). Storybook serves as a living style guide: developers and designers can review components here with the Level AI branding applied, and even test responsiveness or edge cases. We include addons like @storybook/addon-a11y to automatically check accessibility rules (color contrast, ARIA labels) within Storybook, ensuring our components remain WCAG-compliant during development. We also include Storybook Docs pages with MDX to provide additional usage notes, dos and don’ts, and the design rationale for certain components. This Storybook can be deployed at ui.wearelevel.ai (or a similar domain) so that all team members have a single source of truth for the UI components and their usage. In addition to Storybook, we integrate testing tools: for example, we use React Testing Library and Jest for unit tests of component logic (ensuring that interactive behaviors, such as a Modal opening and closing or a form validation message, work correctly). We also consider visual regression testing (using Storybook interactions or tools like Chromatic) to catch any unintended style changes.

Cross-Platform Support (React Native): One of the key aspects of this design system is that it can be used in both React (web) and React Native projects. To achieve this, we provide a parallel implementation of the components for React Native. The design-system-native package contains components that mirror the web ones in purpose and API, but use React Native primitives under the hood. For styling, we leverage NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native) to reuse the same class utilities and design tokens on mobile . This means we can often use the same class names (e.g., bg-sunshine for a yellow background) in the RN components via NativeWind, and it will apply the corresponding styles from the Tailwind config. The RN components might wrap something like Pressable or TouchableOpacity for Button, TextInput for Input, etc., applying the styles and any necessary accessibility roles (using React Native ARIA or community primitives to mimic Radix’s accessibility on mobile). We ensure the typography on React Native also uses our fonts (by integrating the custom fonts in the native app and referencing them in the styles). The result is a set of consistently styled components on mobile, allowing Level AI’s mobile apps to look and feel just like the web products. Developers can import from the native library and use components such as <LevelButton> or <LevelToggle> in their RN code, getting the proper colors, fonts, and behavior. Under the hood, these components are built to be as light as possible – using either pure React Native or Expo libraries (for things like icons or modals) but skinned with our design tokens. We also document any platform-specific guidelines (for example, touch target sizes, mobile-specific accessibility like TalkBack/VoiceOver support, etc.) in the design system documentation.

Color Palette

The Level AI brand colors are central to the theming of the design system. The palette consists of seven core colors as specified in the brand guidelines , grouped into primary and secondary sets. These colors are integrated into the design system as Tailwind color tokens and CSS variables, and are used throughout components for backgrounds, text, and highlights. In summary, the colors include:
•	Earthstone (#293f3b): A deep earth-tone green/teal, used as a primary dark color (e.g. text on light backgrounds, dark backgrounds, or heavy UI elements). This often serves as a base for dark mode backgrounds or body text because of its depth .
•	Pale Dawn (#ffffdc): A very light, dawn-like yellow (almost off-white). Used as a background color or secondary neutral. For instance, Pale Dawn can be used as a light theme background or highlight area, providing a subtle warm tint instead of pure white .
•	Sunset Coral (#ff7f7a): A soft coral red, likely used as an accent or error state color. In the design system, this might be the color for error messages or destructive actions (e.g., a Delete button), aligning with its warm, attention-grabbing nature .
•	Sunshine Yellow (#feda00): The signature Level AI yellow – bright and attention-catching. This is often the primary brand color seen in the logo background and key highlights. In our components, Sunshine Yellow is used for primary call-to-action buttons, link hovers, highlights, and other elements that need to stand out. We ensure that text on this yellow (usually black or Earthstone) has sufficient contrast .
•	Amber Glow (#ff9012): A warm amber-orange tone. This serves as a secondary accent color – for example, it might be used for warning messages or less prominent buttons (like a secondary action next to a primary one). It complements the yellow while providing a slightly darker, orange hue option in the UI.
•	Terra Green (#296b42): A rich green reminiscent of lush greenery. This can be used to signify success states or confirmations (for instance, a success alert background or a “Save” button variant). It pairs well with the other colors and reinforces the “earth” theme in the brand.
•	Verdant Spring (#94da18): A bright, spring green. This more vibrant green can be another accent, possibly used for hover states or to draw attention to stats/graphics, etc. It might also signify success or positive trends in data visualizations, given its brightness.

All these colors are available as CSS custom properties (e.g., --color-earthstone) and as Tailwind classes (e.g., bg-earthstone, text-sunset-coral, etc., using a normalized naming scheme). The design system documentation provides examples of which color to use when – for instance, using Sunshine Yellow for primary buttons or highlights, Earthstone for text or dark backgrounds, and Pale Dawn for page background in light mode, etc. We also include guidance to avoid low-contrast color combinations. For example, pairing light text on light background is avoided, and we leverage the brand colors in ways that meet accessibility. The brand guidelines explicitly note that colors should be used in combinations meeting WCAG AA contrast standards , so our default styles always reflect that (e.g., the default text color on the Sunshine Yellow button is Earthstone or black for contrast, whereas on an Earthstone dark background, we use Pale Dawn or white text). Developers can also use these color tokens in their own custom styling if needed, to ensure any custom component still stays on-brand.

Typography

Typography in the design system follows the Level AI brand specs. We include and configure the two brand typefaces: DM Sans and Concert One. Both fonts are open-source (OFL) and obtained via Google Fonts . In the repository, we either import them via a CSS @import/ from Google Fonts or bundle the font files for offline usage. The Tailwind theme is set to use DM Sans as the default sans-serif font for all text (e.g., font-sans maps to "DM Sans", sans-serif). DM Sans is a clean, modern sans-serif that is used “for almost all purposes” in the brand , so it will be the primary font for body text, form inputs, labels, menus, etc. We include the recommended weights from the guidelines: Medium (500), Medium Italic, ExtraBold (800), and ExtraBold Italic . These are available as utility classes (via Tailwind’s font-medium, font-extrabold, and italic classes) and we also expose them in design tokens (for example, as part of a typography scale in the design-tokens package if needed). Headings and important highlights can use Concert One, a bold display font that was used in the Level AI logo itself . Concert One is a playful, rounded display typeface meant for large sizes. In our design system, we use Concert One sparingly, as per the guidelines (e.g., for hero section text, or maybe the company name in a header). We create a Tailwind utility for it, perhaps mapping font-display to "Concert One", cursive (since it’s more decorative). Additionally, our design tokens define a typographic scale (styles for headings H1 through H6, body text, captions, etc.) that developers can use. For example, an H1 might be DM Sans ExtraBold 3rem, H2 DM Sans ExtraBold 2.5rem, etc., while a special variant could be Concert One at similar sizes for specific use cases (like a marketing tagline). We ensure line-heights and letter-spacing are tuned for readability. These typographic styles are documented in Storybook’s Typography page, showing samples of each. By centralizing font usage, we make it easy to maintain consistency: if the brand ever updates fonts or we need to adjust sizes for responsiveness, it can be done in one place. Both web and React Native use these fonts – for React Native, we include the font files in the app or use an expo Google Fonts package and then apply them via fontFamily style in our components, so text renders with DM Sans or Concert One as appropriate. In summary, text across all Level AI products will look uniform and on-brand, using DM Sans for the bulk of content and Concert One for those special standout moments .

Components and Variants

We include the standard set of components from shadcn/ui – covering everything from basic form controls to complex interactive widgets – all styled to align with Level AI’s visual language. Thanks to shadcn (which itself builds on Radix UI), our components are accessible, keyboard-navigable, and screen-reader friendly out of the box . Below is an overview of key components in the system and how they are tailored:
•	Buttons – Various types of buttons (e.g., Primary solid button, Secondary outline button, Text button) are provided. The Primary button uses Sunshine Yellow background by default to stand out, with bold DM Sans text in a dark color for contrast. Secondary buttons might use Earthstone as border/text on a lighter background or be inverted in dark mode. All buttons have consistent border-radius (e.g., 4px or 0.25rem by default, unless the brand uses more rounded “lozenge” shapes). They also include interactive states: hover (e.g., slightly darker or lighter shade), active, focus (with a visible focus ring for accessibility). Disabled state uses a muted version of the color palette (still meeting contrast requirements). The button component is built on shadcn’s <Button> and supports all the same props (size variants, icons, etc.), but with our theme applied.
•	Forms and Inputs – We provide text inputs, textareas, select dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, toggles (switches), and sliders. Each form element is styled with our colors and spacing. For example, focus rings on inputs use Amber Glow or Terra Green to be clearly visible (and accessible) rather than the default browser blue. Checkboxes and radio buttons use a custom style (possibly using Radix’s Checkbox for accessible custom checkboxes) and are filled with Terra Green or Sunshine Yellow when checked, indicating an active selection in a friendly way. All form labels use DM Sans and our text color. We also include form validation states: e.g., an invalid field might get a Sunset Coral border and an error message in Sunset Coral text to indicate an issue, using the brand’s red shade. We integrate with libraries like React Hook Form for form state management (shadcn/ui has an example of integration ) so that using our form components with validation is seamless.
•	Layout Components – We include basic layout primitives such as a Card component (with a slight shadow or border per brand style, and padding, using Pale Dawn or white in light mode and Earthstone or a dark grey in dark mode as background). Also a Panel/Sidebar component for side navigation or drawers, styled in brand colors. An Accordion for collapsible sections, etc. These use the Radix primitives but skinned for our theme. For example, the Card might use --card and --card-foreground variables internally (mapped to appropriate brand colors for each theme). Accordions and Tabs use our typography and show active states with brand colors (like an active tab underline in Sunshine Yellow).
•	Feedback Components – This includes Modal Dialogs, Toasts, Notifications, Tooltips, and Progress/Spinner. Modal dialogs (built with Radix Dialog) are styled with our backgrounds and fonts; e.g., the modal header might have a colored accent bar or the close button might use an icon in Earthstone. Toast notifications can come in variants (success in Terra Green, error in Sunset Coral, info in Sunshine Yellow, etc.), each picking the appropriate colors and icons. Tooltips use a subtle Earthstone or dark background with Pale Dawn text in light mode (and vice versa in dark mode), ensuring they are readable. A loading spinner or progress bar might use Amber Glow or Verdant Spring depending on context, again keeping within the palette.
•	Navigation Components – We provide components like Navbar/Header, Dropdown Menu, Sidebar, and Breadcrumbs. The Navbar can include the Level AI logo and use Earthstone as background (or Sunshine Yellow, depending on design preference), with menu links in DM Sans. We include the Level AI logo component – a React component that renders the SVG logo – to easily drop the branded logo in any header or footer. (The logo component can accept a prop for variant: e.g., color vs monochrome, and will choose the correct SVG accordingly, such as using the white logo variant on a dark background, etc.) The Dropdown and Context Menus are built on Radix’s Popover/Menu primitives and are styled so that the menu items use our highlight on hover (e.g., a subtle Amber Glow background for hovered item in light mode).
•	Data Display – Components such as Table, Badge, Avatar, Chart (if included), and Calendar/Date Picker. Tables are styled with brand colors for header background or stripes (perhaps using Pale Dawn as a subtle alternate row background). Badges (small pill labels) use colors like Sunset Coral or Verdant Spring to indicate categories or statuses, with appropriate text color (white or dark based on contrast). Avatars (which could include user initials) might use a circle with one of the brand secondary colors as background for variety, and white text for initials. We also include an Icon set – while the brand guidelines don’t specify a custom icon family, we likely use an open-source icon library (such as Lucide or Heroicons as included in shadcn) for UI icons. We ensure these icons are styled (or at least colored) in line with the design (for example, default icon color is Earthstone or current text color, and on dark backgrounds icons might switch to Pale Dawn).

All components are documented with examples of usage in Storybook. We also provide guidance on composition – e.g., how to use our Button and Input together in a form, or how to place an icon inside a Button. Since shadcn’s components cover a broad range , developers should find everything needed for typical UI construction in our library, but if something is missing, we have guidelines for extending the system. The design system encourages using these standardized components rather than custom-styling elements from scratch, to maintain consistency. However, if custom components are needed, developers can still use the Level AI Tailwind theme classes to style them so they visually integrate with the rest.

Brand Assets and Logos

A key part of the Level AI identity is the logo and related visual assets. The design system repository includes SVG assets for all official logo variations, so developers can easily use them in any module. Specifically, we provide:
•	Primary Logo (Horizontal) – The main Level AI logo with the logomark and wordmark in a horizontal arrangement. The primary full-color version is typically displayed on the signature Sunshine Yellow background (as seen in brand materials). We supply this as an SVG with a transparent background; in usage, one can place it on a yellow strip or use the alternate version that includes the yellow lozenge shape behind it.
•	Secondary Logo (Vertical) – An alternate lockup with the logomark above the wordmark , for use in vertical layouts or square formats. This also comes in full color (and a version with the yellow container if needed).
•	Dark Mode Logo – A version of the logo optimized for dark backgrounds . Typically this might have the wordmark text in white instead of Earthstone, and possibly adjusted colors so that it’s visible on a dark background without the yellow field. We include a variant of both the horizontal and vertical logos for dark mode usage.
•	Monochrome Logos – All-white and all-black versions of the logo . These are for special cases or graphic constraints (e.g., printing in black and white, or overlaying the logo on a busy background where only a solid single-color version works). For example, a white logo might be used on a dark video background, and a black logo on a very light background.
•	Logomark Icon – The “scales” symbol from the logo (the icon composed of the dots and modified L/V shapes) provided separately. This can be used as a favicon, app icon, or social media avatar . The brand guidelines mentioned a social avatar usage , which likely is just this mark, possibly on a consistent background. We include the icon in appropriate formats (SVG, and maybe exported PNGs for convenience at various resolutions) so it can be used independently of the wordmark.

All these assets are stored in the assets/ folder (e.g., assets/LogoPrimary.svg, LogoPrimaryLozenge.svg, LogoSecondary.svg, LogoMark.svg, etc.). The design system also provides a simple <Logo /> React component that can render these. For instance, <Logo variant="primary" background="lozenge" /> could render the primary logo with the yellow lozenge behind it, whereas <Logo variant="primary" /> might assume it’s on a yellow background section and just render the transparent version. Similarly, the component can accept a colorScheme prop to switch to the white or black logo as needed (or this can be determined automatically based on theme — e.g., if in dark theme, use the version of the logo that is optimized for dark mode). This simplifies using the logo correctly without each team having to remember which file to use. Developers working in React Native can also use these SVGs (with an appropriate SVG library) or we provide PNG assets for RN if SVG support is problematic. By centralizing the logo assets, we ensure the latest approved versions are used everywhere and if branding ever updates (e.g., a logo tweak), we can update the files in one place. The repository documentation includes a section on Brand Assets explaining proper usage – e.g., clearspace around the logo, minimum sizes (if relevant), and examples of correct and incorrect usage, in line with guidelines. We reference the brand guidelines for any such rules, to make sure implementation aligns with design intent.

Accessibility and WCAG Compliance

From the ground up, the Level AI design system is built to be accessible to all users. By using shadcn/Radix UI components, we inherit a lot of best practices: for example, all dialogs have proper ARIA roles and focus trapping, menus can be navigated with arrow keys, and so on . We don’t treat accessibility as an afterthought – each component is tested for screen reader output and keyboard interaction. The color palette usage is carefully managed to maintain contrast. As noted earlier, the brand colors are used in ways that meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (at least ~4.5:1 for text) . We verify this by testing components in Storybook’s a11y addon and using tools (like Axe) in our test suites. We also ensure that our code meets semantic HTML standards: e.g., using proper <label> elements for inputs, <button> elements for clickable buttons (not just divs), heading tags for titles, etc., so that assistive technologies can parse the UI structure. The focus states are clearly visible (tailored in CSS to not rely solely on the default outline if it doesn’t meet our design/contrast, often we use a high-contrast ring or border). For any interactive component that appears or disappears (like modals or popovers), we provide accessible cues or fallbacks: Radix handles aria-hidden on background content, and our Toast announcements could use aria-live regions. In React Native, we use analogous accessibility properties (like accessibilityLabel, accessible roles, etc.) to ensure compatibility with TalkBack/VoiceOver. Furthermore, we document any accessibility considerations in the component docs – for example, if a component needs a certain prop for accessibility (like providing an aria-label for an icon-only button), we call that out in usage guidelines. By adhering to both the brand guidelines and accessibility standards, the Level AI design system ensures that our applications are not only visually cohesive and beautiful, but also usable by people of all abilities.

Usage Examples

Finally, to illustrate how developers would use the Level AI Design System, here are a few examples of importing and using components in an application:

Using the Design System in a React (Web) app

First, install the design system package (if published to NPM, e.g. @levelai/design-system-web):
npm install @levelai/design-system-web
Import the Tailwind CSS once (e.g., in your root index.tsx or App component):
import '@levelai/design-system-web/styles.css';  // includes Tailwind base & our theme
Then you can import and use the components. For example, to use a button and input from the library:
import { Button, Input } from '@levelai/design-system-web';

function SignupForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <Input label="Email" placeholder="name@example.com" type="email" required />
      <Button variant="primary" type="submit">Sign Up</Button>
    </form>
  );
}
In this snippet, <Input> might be our styled text field component (which automatically applies the proper font and a styled label), and <Button> is our brand-styled button. The variant="primary" prop chooses the Sunshine Yellow filled style. These components will automatically adapt to the current theme (light or dark). By default, if your app has no dark-mode toggling, it will show the light theme. To enable dark mode, you could simply add the dark class to your html or body element, or use our provided <ThemeProvider> component (if we include one) to toggle via context. For example:
<html className="dark">  {/* force dark mode for demonstration */}
// ... in JSX:
<Card>
  <p>This card will use dark theme colors when .dark is on a parent.</p>
</Card>
If using the <ThemeProvider>, it might wrap your app and allow switching the theme by changing a state (which toggles a data attribute).

Additionally, using the Logo component:
import { Logo } from '@levelai/design-system-web';
...
<header className="bg-earthstone p-4 flex items-center">
  <Logo variant="primary" colorScheme="on-dark" /> 
  {/* This will render the primary logo in a form suitable for dark background (e.g., white text) */}
  <nav> ... </nav>
</header>
Here we placed the logo on an Earthstone background (dark), and we instructed the Logo component to use the appropriate variant for dark backgrounds. The rest of the nav links would be styled with our typography (DM Sans in Pale Dawn perhaps for visibility).

Using the Design System in a React Native app

For React Native, install the native package:
npm install @levelai/design-system-native
Ensure that the custom fonts (DM Sans, Concert One) are linked in the app (we provide instructions in the README for how to do this, either via Expo or linking the font files). Also install and configure NativeWind (Tailwind for RN) as explained in our docs (likely adding a Tailwind config for NativeWind, which can re-use our design tokens). Then, use the components in your RN code:
import { LevelButton, LevelInput, ThemeProvider } from 'levelai-design-system-native';

export default function LoginScreen() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme="light"> 
      {/* ThemeProvider could manage theme, or use device color scheme by default */}
      <View style={{ padding: 16 }}>
        <LevelInput label="Username" placeholder="enter username" />
        <LevelInput label="Password" placeholder="enter password" secureTextEntry />
        <LevelButton variant="primary" onPress={handleLogin}>
          Login
        </LevelButton>
      </View>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
In this example, <LevelInput> might render a React Native <TextInput> with our styled label and styling (using NativeWind classes internally for padding, border, etc.), and <LevelButton> wraps a TouchableOpacity/Pressable and applies our button styles (e.g., a yellow background, rounded corners, and a Text child with DM Sans font). The ThemeProvider here is optional – it could allow toggling dark mode in the app or default to phone settings; internally it might apply a context or style that sets the appropriate color variables for NativeWind. If the app is using Expo, the fonts can be loaded using useFonts (we provide the font files in the package or via expo-google-fonts). The end result is that the RN app’s UI elements will visually match the web app’s, and developers use a similar API. (For instance, the variant="primary" prop for LevelButton works in both web and native to get the yellow style.)

Theming and Customization Example

If Level AI or another project wants to adjust the theme (say introduce a new color or change the default font), the design system allows that via configuration. For example, a developer could extend the Tailwind config or override CSS variables at runtime. Suppose we wanted a high-contrast theme for accessibility: we could add a new data-theme in CSS with adjusted colors (maybe black and white primarily), and then in the app do <ThemeProvider theme="highContrast"> to apply it. All components would then automatically use those new values (thanks to CSS variable binding). Another example: if using the design system for a client that requires slight branding tweaks, since it’s open-source code, they could fork the theme config. The documentation in the repo guides how to safely make such overrides if ever necessary, although the core Level AI products will use the default Level AI theme.

Conclusion

Level AI’s design system is a complete, robust toolkit that translates the brand’s style guide into code. It provides a unified set of components – from buttons to modals to charts – that developers can trust to be consistent and accessible. By leveraging shadcn/ui and Tailwind, it balances speed (pre-built, ready-to-use components) with customizability (we can tailor every style to fit our brand) . The inclusion of Storybook and testing ensures quality and fosters collaboration between designers and developers, who can speak the same language of “Level AI components” and design tokens. And with support for both web and mobile, the design system truly becomes a single source of truth for all UI development at Level AI, making our products cohesive no matter where users experience them.

Sources: The design decisions and assets are based on the Level AI Brand Guidelines and best practices from the shadcn/UI framework . All color values, typography choices, and logo usages have been implemented according to the official specifications to ensure brand consistency and accessibility. The system will continue to evolve, but it stands as a solid foundation for building unified Level AI user interfaces.
