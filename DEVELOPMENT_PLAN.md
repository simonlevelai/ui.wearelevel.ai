- Basic CI pipeline running on GitHub Actions

### Week 2: Core Components
- [ ] Set up shadcn/ui foundation
- [ ] Implement 3 critical components: Button, Input, Card
- [ ] Customize components with Level AI brand tokens
- [ ] Create Storybook documentation for each component
- [ ] Set up basic testing framework

**Deliverables:**
- 3 production-ready components
- Storybook with accessibility checks
- Component test suite

### Week 3: Cross-Platform Validation
- [ ] Set up NativeWind in design-system-native
- [ ] Create mobile versions of core components
- [ ] Implement design token synchronization
- [ ] Test component integration in sample app
- [ ] Document any platform limitations

**Deliverables:**
- Mobile component equivalents
- Token sync system between web/native
- Integration testing results

## Phase 2: Expansion & Integration (Weeks 4-8)

### Weeks 4-5: Component Library Growth
- [ ] Add 8-10 additional components (Modal, Alert, Table, Form elements)
- [ ] Implement composition patterns for customization
- [ ] Create component variants and size options
- [ ] Add comprehensive accessibility testing
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing

**Deliverables:**
- Complete component library (15+ components)
- Accessibility compliance documentation
- Visual regression test suite

### Weeks 6-7: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement theming system (dark mode support)
- [ ] Add animation/transition utilities
- [ ] Create complex composite components (DataTable, Form layouts)
- [ ] Set up bundle size monitoring
- [ ] Optimize performance and tree-shaking

**Deliverables:**
- Theming system with dark mode
- Performance optimization report
- Bundle size monitoring dashboard

### Week 8: Production Readiness
- [ ] Set up automated publishing pipeline
- [ ] Create comprehensive migration guides
- [ ] Implement breaking change detection
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Conduct security review

**Deliverables:**
- Automated publishing to GitHub Packages
- Migration documentation
- Security audit results

## Phase 3: Pilot Deployment (Weeks 9-12)

### Weeks 9-10: Pilot Application
- [ ] Select low-risk application for pilot deployment
- [ ] Migrate 3-5 screens to use design system components
- [ ] Collect performance metrics and user feedback
- [ ] Document integration patterns and edge cases
- [ ] Refine component APIs based on real usage

**Deliverables:**
- Pilot application successfully using design system
- Performance impact analysis
- Updated component APIs

### Weeks 11-12: Feedback Integration
- [ ] Implement feedback from pilot deployment
- [ ] Add missing components identified during pilot
- [ ] Improve developer experience based on feedback
- [ ] Create training materials for development teams
- [ ] Plan broader rollout strategy

**Deliverables:**
- Refined component library
- Developer training materials
- Rollout strategy document

## Phase 4: Organization-Wide Rollout (Weeks 13-20)

### Weeks 13-16: Gradual Adoption
- [ ] Roll out to 2-3 additional applications
- [ ] Provide hands-on training to development teams
- [ ] Monitor adoption metrics and component usage
- [ ] Continue iterating based on feedback
- [ ] Establish design system governance

**Deliverables:**
- 3-4 applications using design system
- Training completion metrics
- Governance framework

### Weeks 17-20: Full Deployment
- [ ] Complete migration of all existing applications
- [ ] Establish design system as default for new projects
- [ ] Set up contribution guidelines for new components
- [ ] Implement design-developer workflow
- [ ] Create long-term maintenance plan

**Deliverables:**
- Organization-wide design system adoption
- Contribution guidelines
- Maintenance and evolution plan

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
- **NativeWind limitations**: Create fallback styling approach for unsupported features
- **Design token drift**: Implement automated validation and sync processes
- **Performance issues**: Continuous monitoring and optimization
- **Breaking changes**: Semantic versioning and deprecation warnings

### Adoption Risks
- **Team resistance**: Comprehensive training and gradual migration
- **Integration complexity**: Detailed documentation and example patterns
- **Maintenance burden**: Clear governance and contribution processes

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Component test coverage: >90%
- Accessibility compliance: WCAG AA
- Bundle size impact: <10% increase over baseline
- Build time improvement: >20% faster with caching

### Adoption Metrics
- Developer satisfaction: >8/10 in surveys
- Time to implement new features: 30% reduction
- Design-development handoff time: 50% reduction
- Component reuse rate: >80% for common patterns

## Resource Requirements

### Team Structure
- **Tech Lead**: Overall architecture and strategy
- **Frontend Developer**: Web component implementation
- **Mobile Developer**: React Native component implementation
- **Designer**: Design token validation and documentation
- **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD and deployment automation

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 20 weeks (5 months)
- **Critical Path**: Foundation → Core Components → Platform Validation
- **Key Milestones**: Week 3 (validation), Week 8 (production ready), Week 12 (pilot complete)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Secure team resources and begin repository setup
2. **Short-term (Weeks 1-3)**: Focus on foundation and validation
3. **Medium-term (Weeks 4-12)**: Build complete library and pilot deployment
4. **Long-term (Weeks 13-20)**: Organization-wide rollout and governance
